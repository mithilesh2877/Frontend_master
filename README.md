## Overview

To recreate this component for desktop:

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

My initial step was to remove any padding and margin applied to the page and set the box-sizing to border-box in order to enable me to control the element sizes.
I then created a framework of the HTML elements and styled with CSS to recreate the way the page looks.
When I was happy with the layout I used a JavaScript file to fetch the data.json file. I used query selectors to 'grab' the HTML elements I needed and created functions to iterate over the information in the data.json file and inject the correct information into the elements on the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge was really good for working on CSS gradients and layouts using a combination of grid and flexbox.
